When you choose SambaSafety, you already know it's not about  taking drivers out from behind the wheel. It's about putting safety first so you can keep drivers on the road.

We create one comprehensive driver profile by continuously monitoring MVRs and giving you the complete picture of driver safety, risk and compliance.

— Improve driver performance
— Reduce accidents
— Lower costs
— Protect what's important

It's more than safety, it's a safety culture – identifying, monitoring and modifying behaviors so drivers keep up the good work and keep your company out of the headlines.
