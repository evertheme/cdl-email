Samba DriverMonitor® is the key to our system that helps Identify, Monitor and Modify driver behavior.

— Identify your risk as you optimize compliance, background checks and MVR history
— Monitor continuously with ongoing MVRs, incident and crash tracking, and external data
— Modify behavior with incentives, enforcement and online training to keep drivers safe

On average, 10% of drivers make up 40% of crash-related costs. But now, you can do something about it before it's too late.

Check out the Samba DriverMonitor Datasheet. You'll see how this automated foundation of our risk management solution enables more efficient enforcement of your driver safety policy – allowing you to focus on the most critical drivers.
