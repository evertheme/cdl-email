Three ways our data goes to work for you:

1. We start with a comprehensive baseline MVR that scores drivers on day 1, identifying the best ones or those who need training

2. Then we continuously monitor CSA and MVR data, giving you  a complete picture of driver safety, risk and compliance in one report

3. From there, you can intervene with remedies to maintain a team  of drivers who are consistently safe on the road

It's true – with SambaSafety technology, you have a continuous, comprehensive view of MVR and CSA data to monitor driver performance, identify risks and modify behavior. Learn more about driver safety facts with our True or False Quiz.
