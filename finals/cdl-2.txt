Why is a safety culture important?
Here are 10 tricky questions clients ask us:

Q:  What if I pull an MVR and my driver gets a citation after that?
Q:  Isn't it unfair to access off-the-job records for a driver's performance on the job?
Q:  I pulled an MVR for a background screen – why do I need another?

See all ten Q's and the Answers on the downloadable PDF.

It's one thing to say you're safe. It's another thing to be comprehensive, to be continuously monitoring and to be constantly enforcing your policy. The answers to the 10 Questions will show why it's important and help you move toward a proactive safety culture today.
