SambaSafety believes that it's one thing to have a driver safety policy and another to enforce it. Statistics show that you have to be proactive, enforce your policy and pursue an overall safety culture – or your driver may very well become one of those statistics.

Your safety policy helps modify driver behavior when you:

1. Measure your drivers against your policy

2. Provide online training targeted to individual drivers

3. Offer incentives to reinforce successful drivers

4. Benchmark and compare performance to others

Creating a culture and enforcing policy helps you promote safety, modify behavior and keep you out of the headlines. Download the Startling Stats infographic to get started.
