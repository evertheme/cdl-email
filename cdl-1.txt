When you choose SambaSafety, you already know it’s not about
 taking drivers out from behind the wheel. It’s about putting
safety first so you can keep drivers on the road.

We create one comprehensive driver profile by combining continuous
MVR and CSA monitoring to give you the complete picture of driver
safety, risk and compliance.

— Improve driver performance
— Reduce accidents
— Eliminate OOS orders
— Lower CSA scores

It’s more than safety, it’s a safety culture – identifying, monitoring
and modifying behaviors so drivers keep up the good work and keep your company
out of the headlines.
